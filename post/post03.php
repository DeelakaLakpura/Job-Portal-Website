            <p><strong>How to Accept a Job Offer</strong></p>
            <p>
             
Express Your Appreciation for the Job Offer
Whether you're communicating in person, on the phone, or via email, thank the person who made the offer and say how excited and grateful you are before you do anything else. Whether you're going to come back with a negotiation or accept the offer without changes, starting off this way sets a good tone for the conversation. Keep up the enthusiasm as you move forward. Remember that the company is vulnerable—you might not accept their offer—so make them feel less so with your interest in the role. Using words like "excited" and "thrilled" will get the point across, without saying you're accepting the position.

Ask to Get the Offer in Writing
Learning how to accept a job offer means you need to know exactly what you're saying yes to. Once you've thanked the employer, request to have the offer put in writing. An official job offer letter should include, at the very least, the name of the position, a start date, a salary, and details about benefits.

This step does two things:

It makes the offer official.
It gives you a chance to review the details thoroughly to make sure you completely understand what you're being offered.
Ask how long you have to give a final answer after receiving the letter. If the employer says they need an immediate answer, that's a bad sign. Accepting a job offer properly requires due diligence, and a company is very much aware of this. Pressuring you doesn't give the best impression and tends to be used as a scare tactic. A responsible employer wants prospective employees to have some time to think—usually a day or two—before accepting a job offer. But if you want to negotiate the terms, respond by saying: "I've considered the offer and it's a wonderful opportunity; I would want to discuss the details more carefully. When can we set up a time to speak or meet?" Be prepared with the right questions to ask when negotiating salary, and remember that you should take a collaborative, not confrontational, tone in your negotiation. After all, both of you want the same thing—you in that job.

Know What to Say When Accepting a Job Offer
When you're through negotiating and ready to accept, reiterate all the details as you understand them in your acceptance. You can say: "It is my understanding that I will be eligible for X days of vacation, Y amount of bonus payable on Z, the company covers 75% of my health care costs and matches my 401K contributions up to the first 3% of my salary." This is especially important if you've negotiated up from the initial offer. In fact, you should also ask to get the final, official offer in writing. If the negotiations took longer than expected, acknowledge that in your acceptance. Negotiation is stressful for both sides and expressing appreciation for your new employer's time and effort once you finally accept an offer shows you're ready to move forward. Finally, ask about the next steps. For example, is there any onboarding paperwork you should get started on after accepting a job offer? Will there be an orientation? And how can you prepare for your first day? This shows your interest, which will reaffirm to the company that they made the right choice in hiring you.       </p>

            <p><strong>Pros and Cons of Negotiating a Salary Offer
            </strong></p>
            <p><u>Pro: Negotiating a Salary Offer Is a Must</u></p>
            <p class="note note-light">
                When a company finds the right candidate, it is more than likely willing to negotiate salary. Recruiters usually have a second and third choice lined up but it's never as good as the first choice. There's usually more budget available for Candidate No. 1. Obviously, companies have to abide by their budgets, but negotiating a salary offer is just part of the hiring process. If you're at the stage where the employer is negotiating salary with you, the employer wants you—they're aware of your value. Just because you push back at their first offer doesn't mean your value is going to up and disappear. Another salary negotiation tip to know is that for some positions, you are simply expected to negotiate regardless of the offer. For example, if you're pursuing a business development or sales position, a casual acceptance of the initial offer might actually hurt your chances because it shows a neglect for a basic element of all business dealings: negotiation. Meaning, salary negotiation is a prime chance for you to show your skill and appreciation for the exercise. If you let that opportunity pass you by, the employer might think you're inept.
            </p>
            <p><u>Con: There Are Times to Avoid Salary Negotiation</u></p>
            <p>Some career experts say there are definite instances when you shouldn't be negotiating a salary offer at all. For instance:


                There's no good reason you should be paid more than you're offered
                Granted, if pushing back can reveal some of your previous accomplishments, contributions to your department, and/or prized skills that human resources overlooked in their initial review, your counteroffer might be honored. But in other cases, if you can't justify your salary ask, you risk having the offer rescinded.
                
                You're asking for too much
                Negotiating salary when there's a big gap between what the company is offering and what you want is also a waste of time. Let's say a recent grad is looking at entry-level jobs in his field of training and learns early on that the jobs are paying an admittedly low salary for the industry. This person shouldn't go through several rounds of interviews and then demand double what the employer was willing to pay. He created no room for negotiation and dug his heels in. There's no way he'll be offered the job. Negotiating a job offer is always a risk, but by not accepting the offer in a timely manner, you're leaving the door wide open for other candidates to walk right into the picture.</p>
                <p><u>Salary: One Part of a Bigger Picture</u></p>
                <p>Salary is just one component of the offer package, but it's the one that most often generates a gut response if it's too low or euphoria if it's more than you were expecting. However, what may be just as important is whether you feel passionate about what the company does, you trust your peers, and you believe the role is one in which you can truly thrive, be successful, and be happy. An average or even below-average compensation package that offers great leadership, peer support, and a product or service you believe in will likely result in you performing to the best of your abilities. In turn, you can expect bonuses, greater responsibilities, more job security, and promotions. In the end, job conditions dictate what you can achieve and, therefore, your future compensation, not the other way around.</p>
                <p><u>Knowledge Is Power</u></p>
                <p>Negotiating a salary offer is just one of the many touchstones along your career path. The more prepared you are for the challenges, the better you'll fare.
